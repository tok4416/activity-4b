# Selenium Drivers

This directory contains the Selenium drivers for multiple Operating Systems
and multiple Browsers.

Before executing the test code you must install at least one Selenium driver here.


## How to Install Drivers

This section describes how to install a browser-specific driver.


### Chrome Driver

This section provides a sketch of how to install the Google Chrome browser driver.

To install Chrome [click here](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download)

To install Chrome driver [click here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads)

Also see:
 * [ChromeDriver docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver)
 * [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)

#### Mac OS X

Unpack the archive file and copy the driver, `chromedriver`, in the `drivers/mac/` directory.

There are times when you download executable software that the Mac OS will refuse to
run the application.  You will not need to "open" the driver app
through the _System Settings... -> Privacy -> Security section_.

The Safari browser is not available on Windows.

#### Linux

The Safari browser is not available on Linux.


### MS Edge Driver

## Troubleshooting

This section describes various issues with Driver installation.

### Browser Version Mismatch

The most frequent problem is that the version of the browser you installed does not match
the version of the driver.  This happens a lot in Chrome and Safari if you have automatic
updates turned on.

The symptom you will see is that the driver fails to establish a "session" with the browser
application.  You will see an error message like this:

```text
SessionNotCreatedError: session not created:
 This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 85 Build info:
 version: '3.141.59', revision: 'e82be7d358', time: '2018-11-14T08:25:53'
```

You will need to discover the version number of the currently installed browser and then
use a web search to find the appropriate driver version and install that.
